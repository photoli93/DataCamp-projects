They are easy to create and can be very lucrative from the business standpoint. Specifically, Android is expanding as an operating system and has captured more than 74% of the total market<sup><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009\">[1]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>The Google Play Store apps data has enormous potential to facilitate data-driven decisions and insights for businesses. In this notebook, we will analyze the Android app market by comparing ~10k apps in Google Play across different categories. We will also use the user reviews to draw a qualitative comparision between the apps.</p>\n<p>The dataset you will use here was scraped from Google Play Store in September 2018 and was published on <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps\">Kaggle</a>.

There are 9 features that describe a given app.\n<ul>\n    <li><b>App:</b> Name of the app</li>\n    <li><b>Category:</b> Category of the app. Some examples are: ART_AND_DESIGN, FINANCE, COMICS, BEAUTY etc.</li>\n    <li><b>Rating:</b> The current average rating (out of 5) of the app on Google Play</li>\n    <li><b>Reviews:</b> Number of user reviews given on the app</li>\n    <li><b>Size:</b> Size of the app in MB (megabytes)</li>\n    <li><b>Installs:</b> Number of times the app was downloaded from Google Play</li>\n    <li><b>Type:</b> Whether the app is paid or free</li>\n    <li><b>Price:</b> Price of the app in US$</li>\n    <li><b>Last Updated:</b> Date on which the app was last updated on Google Play </li>\n\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #efebe4; color: #05192d; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <div style=\"font-size:20px\"><b>datasets/user_reviews.csv</b></div>\nThis file contains a random sample of 100 <i>[most helpful first](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/01/21/google-play-stores-redesigned-ratings-and-reviews-section-lets-you-easily-filter-by-star-rating/)</i> user reviews for each app. The text in each review has been pre-processed and passed through a sentiment analyzer.\n<ul>\n    <li><b>App:</b> Name of the app on which the user review was provided.
